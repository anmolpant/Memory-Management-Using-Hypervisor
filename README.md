# Memory-Management-Using-Hypervisor
The following repository contains a team project I worked on for the J component of our 'Operating Systems' course.

In the project, we implemented memory management in hypervisor using a code that
creates and manages inverted, hypervisor-level page tables. We start by having a small,
working implementation of guest-level page tables, so that we have a related reference for
implementation.

We have created a virtual machine prototype for the same.

Includes: Code, Application and complete documentation
